# **Air Quality Monitoring and Route Recommendation System**

## **Description**
This project is a demonstration of an air quality monitoring and route recommendation system based on real-time CO2 sensor data. The system utilizes data from six sensors placed strategically on seven roads. The application is designed to showcase how traffic and environmental data can be used to provide practical, environmentally conscious route recommendations.

## **Why is the Project Useful?**
By integrating environmental data into route planning, this system adds a new dimension to traditional navigation systems, which typically focus on parameters like distance and traffic. This project shows that it is possible to not only consider these traditional factors, but also take into account environmental health when choosing a route. This is particularly useful in urban planning and for individuals or organizations aiming to minimize their environmental impact.

## **Getting Started**
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Ensure that you have a modern web browser and a stable internet connection. Next, run the server, open the HTML file in your web browser and interact with the map. You can click on different sensors to view their current readings, and you can use the routing feature to find the most environmentally friendly route between two points.

## **Where to Get Help**
For help with this project, please first refer to the project documentation and comments in the code. If you cannot find the answer to your question there, feel free to raise an issue on the project's GitHub page. While this is a demo project, questions and feedback are welcome as they can help improve the system for real-world applications.
